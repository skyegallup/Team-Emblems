**Team Emblems** is a simple mod for managing vanilla team assignments using items. This allows players to create teams,
disable friendly fire, and more through Minecraft's [built-in team system](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Commands/team)
without commands. Team Emblems uses the [Trinkets mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) for simplicity.
